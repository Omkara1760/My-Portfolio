      <h2 class="ques-1">Pet keeping as a hobby?</h2>

      <p class="ques-1-p">
        <b
          >"Until one has loved an animal, a part of one's soul remains
          unawakened."</b
        >Anatole France Pet as a hobby is one of the most popular and exotic
        hobbies ever. It is one of the most widely adopted hobbies around the
        world. Pet keeping has been around for centuries as man adopted both
        domestic and wild animals taking pride in owning and showing them also
        known as animal fancy. The hobby involves the appreciation, promotion,
        and breeding of pet animals.
      </p>

      <h2 class="ques-2">What pet hobbyists have to say?</h2>

      <p class="ques-2-p">
        The experience of having pet as a hobby as much similar to having
        children. Tending and caring of pets becomes dearer as that of one's
        kids. Also, because pets are adopted, it becomes the sole responsibility
        of the owner or the hobbyist to take care of them just like they's do
        with their offsprings. "When I come home after a long day at the
        hospital or the studio, the greeting I get from my black Lab, Rosie—her
        whole body wiggling with happiness—always makes me smile, no matter how
        exhausted I feel, says Oprah Winfrey - American talk show host and
        philanthropist. "In our household, animals outnumber humans: We also
        have a rabbit, five hamsters, three cats (who spend a great deal of
        their time peering inquisitively at the hamsters), and two tropical
        fish. I admit I sometimes feel like a Zookeeper. But even when the
        litter box needs cleaning or I have to coax my son, Oliver, to go
        outside and walk Rosie before bedtime, I can honestly say I'm happy to
        share my home with all 12 creatures," she continues.

      <h2>Health benefits from a pet companion</h2>

      <p>
        There is mounting evidence that pet as a hobby is especially great to
        improve your physical well-being. The American Psychological Association
        study investigated the therapeutic benefits of investing in the
        attachments to creatures big and small. In fact, thinking of a beloved
        pet can help you stay calm. Animals that surround pet hobbyists affects
        their mood and mental state.
      </p>
      <h3>Lowers blood pressure</h3>

      <p>
        It is found that if you pet an animal or just gaze at them, it reduces
        blood pressure. Pets can improve the cardiovascular system. Owning a pet
        or having the hobby impacts with a better pressure response to mental
        stress. No type of drug can heal hypertension as does the company of
        your pets.
      </p>
      <h3>Reduces risk of allergies</h3>

      <p>
        Exposure to pets during the early years of childhood means less chances
        of developing any inflammatory diseases such as asthma, allergies, or
        eczema. The reason is that the body’s immune system becomes
        anti-receptive to allergens. In fact, an interesting aspect is that pets
        impact the prenatal stage of a child as well. Exposure to animals
        reduces allergen production in the umbilical cord significantly.
      </p>
      <h3>Improves fitness</h3>
      <p>

        some activity with their pets. It is seen that pet as a hobby
        enthusiasts are likely to have an increased physical activity as
        compared to those without animals for petting.
      </p>
      <h3>Strengthens heart</h3>

      <p>
        With a pet companion, the chances of health risks lowers significantly.
        With reduced health ailments you are able to build a stronger
        cardiovascular system. The fact that a pet for company keeps you happy
        also has a lot to do with making your heart stronger and your body

        burden and pain of the disease is reduced for both the patient and their
        families. For a hobbyist with a pet companion you can focus much better
        and develop healthy weight gain as most patients usually suffer from
        nutrition deficiency. "Such short little lives, our pets have to spend
        with us, and they spend most of it waiting for us to come home each
        day." - John Grogan Experience the perks of having a pet as a hobby,
